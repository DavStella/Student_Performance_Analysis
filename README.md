# Student Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyse student performance data to identify key factors affecting academic success and develop a predictive model for student grades.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with the analysis and visualizations.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and visualization.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.

- ## Data
The dataset used in this project is `student_performance_data.csv`, which contains information on student demographics, academic performance, and extracurricular activities.

## Analysis
The analysis includes:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Training and Evaluation
4. Visualizations

## Results
- Identified key factors affecting student performance.
- Developed a predictive model with an accuracy of approximately 92%.
- Visualized the relationships between various factors and GPA.
